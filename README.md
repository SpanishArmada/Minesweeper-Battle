## Project Description

Two-to-four-player real-time minesweeper battle on the same minefield, competing to uncover the most number of correct flags with fewest penalties.

## How to play?

1. Open [client page](http://rawgit.com/pciang/SpanishArmada/master/client/index.html), input in your nickname, then click "Start" to enter the matchmaking queue in order to find a suitable opponent. In one round, there will be at least 2 players and at most 4 players.
2. Play minesweeper normally ([See rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper#Gameplay)).
3. Game is over when all mines are flagged or uncovered.

## Rules

1. Every correct flag is going to rewarded **+1** point, and every wrong flag or triggered mine will penalized the player by **-1** and **-5** points respectively.
2. Winner is determined by highest score. Draw is declared in case of tie.

## Running the programs

### Client and server

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   yarn start
   ```
2. Start server
   ```
   yarn workspace server start
   ```
3. Start client
   ```
   yarn workspace client start
   ```
4. Open browser at `http://localhost:8080`

### Client-AI

1. Client-AI can connect to the server and act as the AI opponent for the match.
2. At "client-ai" folder, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. To run AI, `python main.py`


## Future improvement

1. ~~Allows more than 2 players at one board~~ Done per [dfe5b80](https://github.com/pciang/SpanishArmada/commit/dfe5b807fc8bb2e38893dde4759868dbe1d32ad6)
2. Dynamic board size, according to number of players.
3. Smarter AI. Currently, the AI only moves when there is a trivial action.
4. Records player's game result and predict their skills accordingly.
5. Better matchmaking algorithm according to user skills.
6. Possible additional game modes, e.g. no-flag mode.
7. In-app purchase to obtain special flag design, etc.
